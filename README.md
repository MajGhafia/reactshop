This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

This project was created to give customers the amenities and options of the Costco brand online as if they were in store. The purpose of the application is to bring the products and services to the customers. The friendly staff and services that available in store are also available online as well. Costco Values the customer service and the overall experience and satisfaction of the customers.

Design wise this application is very standard and basic in turn that the customers needs will be met and the application will grow overtime. The principles of the said design are meant to bring out the purpose and meaning behind why the website was created. The color scheme represents the costco brand and the mission statement to put the customers first.

The Costco services and custer help section of the website (still under development) are for customers to provide feedback for our social engineers and staff to examine the behaviors of the customers to better make changes to the website. The Functional reviews are for the design and tech support team to fix any problems with say the shopping cart, upload time/speed etc.

The looks and design of the application are created to give the customers a clean and appealing look. The aesthetics are made to exentuate the shopping cart and give the overall design an inviting feel. The perceptual pattern is that the customers can get access to services, items and from the online website and have an easier time obtaining items and picking up items in store if they so choose.
